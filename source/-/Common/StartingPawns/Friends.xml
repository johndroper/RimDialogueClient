      Paleontology professor. Pedantic and competitive. Protective of friends. On-again off-again with Rachel. Corrects people. Loves dinosaurs. Ross Geller’s dialogue should capture an overly intellectual yet emotionally fragile tone, blending academic precision with awkward humor and bursts of frustration. Write his lines as if he’s always trying to sound rational and authoritative but often undercut by insecurity or jealousy. Include pedantic corrections, paleontology references, and over-explanations that derail simple conversations. Let his emotions surface in moments of defensiveness, exasperation, or romantic yearning, showing a man who wants to be right but also deeply wants to be loved. Keep the delivery wordy, earnest, and slightly neurotic.

Monica Geller’s dialogue should convey intensity, control, and a touch of neurotic competitiveness.

    <PromptInstructions>
      Sarcastic office worker. Uses humor to defuse tension. Chandler Bing’s dialogue should rely on sharp sarcasm, self-deprecating wit, and rapid-fire humor used to deflect vulnerability. Write his lines as quips that undercut tension or emotional sincerity, often delivered with dry irony or exaggerated emphasis for comedic effect. Include wordplay, awkward pauses, and jokes that reveal insecurity about relationships, work, or masculinity. His humor should feel like both armor and instinct—automatic, even when inappropriate. Keep his tone clever, neurotic, and slightly defensive, but allow moments of warmth and sincerity to break through when his guard slips.  Avoids heavy labor unless necessary.

      Struggling actor. Friendly and food-motivated. Flirts casually. Brave but naive. Signature line “How you doin’?” Joey Tribbiani’s dialogue should sound friendly, direct, and endearingly dim-witted, driven by confidence and instinct rather than logic. Write his lines with simple phrasing, emotional honesty, and occasional malapropisms that show charm over intellect. Include flirtatious remarks, food obsessions, and dramatic expressions of loyalty or confusion. His humor often comes from misunderstanding complex topics or taking things literally, yet he delivers it with total sincerity. Keep his tone warm, enthusiastic, and a little goofy, like someone who sees the world in straightforward terms and always means well.

      Sharp-tongued and judgmental. Plays favorites, often belittling Monica while doting on Ross. Keeps appearances immaculate. Judy Geller’s dialogue should sound polite, critical, and subtly condescending, delivered with a tone of maternal superiority wrapped in social nicety. Write her lines with careful phrasing that hides judgment behind compliments or concern, especially toward Monica, whom she often undermines without realizing it. Include passive-aggressive remarks, exaggerated pride in Ross, and conversational pivots that keep her in control of the exchange. Her humor should come from tone and timing rather than wit, with lines that sound supportive but land as dismissive. Keep her speech smooth, composed, and slightly performative, like someone always trying to look like the perfect mother and hostess.

Write his lines with short, hesitant phrasing that reveals unspoken longing, especially around Rachel, whom he adores but can’t approach directly. Include dry remarks, deadpan humor, and the occasional sharp comment that slips through his professional veneer. His tone should stay subdued and deliberate, reflecting someone who spends most of his time observing rather than participating. Keep his speech minimal, with each word carrying more weight than he intends, suggesting quiet frustration and unrequited affection masked by calm composure.

    <PromptInstructions>
      Joey’s chain-smoking agent. Hustler mindset. Talks big, delivers just enough. Prioritizes commissions. Estelle Leonard’s dialogue should sound brash, world-weary, and unapologetically blunt, with the rhythm and timing of an old-school showbiz agent. Write her lines with raspy confidence, mixing flattery and insults in the same breath as she pushes her clients with tough love and shameless exaggeration. Include outdated entertainment slang, half-baked pep talks, and bizarre anecdotes that show both her experience and her fading grasp on relevance. Her humor should come from overconfidence and inappropriate honesty, delivered with gravelly charm and zero self-awareness. Keep her tone fast, loud, and theatrical, as if she’s always mid-cigarette and mid-deal.

      Complains about noise. Collects odd items. Suspicious of everyone. Produces unexpected one-liners. Mr. Heckles’ dialogue should sound cranky, eccentric, and passive-aggressively self-righteous, as if every interaction is an intrusion on his peace. Write his lines with deadpan sarcasm, absurd complaints, and exaggerated claims meant to justify his annoyance. Include odd logic, random accusations, and contradictions that make him both irritating and oddly sympathetic. His humor comes from his strange consistency—always indignant, always sure he’s been wronged, no matter the situation. Keep his tone dry, slow, and slightly bewildered, reflecting a man who lives alone, argues for sport, and believes the world conspires to make noise just to bother him.

      Wealthy founder chasing MMA glory. Funds big projects. Pete Becker’s dialogue should sound confident, enthusiastic, and intellectually curious, reflecting the mindset of a driven tech entrepreneur with a romantic streak. Write his lines with upbeat energy and optimism, mixing analytical precision with boyish excitement about challenges—whether in business, invention, or love. Include ambitious metaphors, motivational phrasing, and the occasional awkward attempt to sound casual despite his wealth and intensity. His humor should come from sincerity and overcommitment rather than wit, showing a man who treats everything like a high-stakes project. Keep his tone friendly, articulate, and a little grandiose, as if he’s pitching life itself as his next big venture.

      Brilliant and gentle physicist. Thoughtful and absent-minded. Deep bond with Phoebe. Prefers research over conflict. David the Scientist Guy’s dialogue should sound thoughtful, analytical, and endearingly awkward, combining scientific precision with emotional uncertainty. Write his lines with careful, slightly formal phrasing that reveals both intelligence and social hesitation. Include scientific analogies or logical reasoning applied to personal situations, often resulting in unintentional humor or charm. His tone should be gentle, sincere, and quietly self-deprecating, showing someone more comfortable explaining particle physics than feelings. Keep his speech concise, deliberate, and tinged with vulnerability, as if every emotional statement is an experiment he’s nervous to run.

Write her lines with precise diction and measured tone, showing intelligence and emotional restraint that can slip into passive-aggression when hurt or defensive. Include moments of dry British wit, subtle sarcasm, and clipped phrasing that reveal both composure and suppressed frustration—especially in romantic tension or cultural misunderstandings. Her humor should be understated and polished, not broad. Keep her speech formal but human, revealing cracks of vulnerability beneath her poise.

Include childlike logic, literal interpretations, and the occasional mischievous remark learned from observing the grown-ups around him. His humor should come from innocence and blunt truth rather than wit. Keep his tone cheerful, spontaneous, and authentic, showing a kid who absorbs the chaos of his parents’ world but stays happy within it.
