    Mod Version: {ReleaseVersion} BETA

    RimDialogue is an extension of Jaxe’s excellent Interaction Bubbles mod, but instead of simply displaying the system-generated interaction text, it takes these interactions and uses a language model to transform them into real dialogue. This dialogue is then displayed in-game above each character’s head in a speech bubble.

    For example, an interaction like, "Huynh and Nila chatted about crazy eels," could turn into something like:
    Huynh: "I've heard the crazy eels in this jungle are as unpredictable as Bowman's sense of humor, Nila."
    Nila: "Tell me about it, Huynh. I've seen them leap out of the water and attack anyone who gets too close."

    This mod can do even more! By adding “Additional Instructions”, you can influence the entire culture of your colony. For instance, try adding instructions like:

    "Everyone in the colony is obsessed with David Hasselhoff."
    Now, many conversations will include references to “the Hoff” and Baywatch.

    "Bob speaks like Albert Einstein."
    This will cause only the pawn named “Bob” to talk about astrophysics.

    "All the men in the colony speak French."
    Now, only the male pawns will speak exclusively in French.
